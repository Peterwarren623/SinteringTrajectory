# SinteringTrajectory
Prediction of Sintering deformation based on Grain Size, Porosity, and Surface Area. This code can also applying the amount of shrinkage that occurs to STL files. This can be used a presintering scale up method for additive manufacturing components that require sintering.

The Sint_Traj_SA only simulates data for the relationship between surface area and fractional density
